# Share-Market-Prices
This gives you historical prices of an NSE share. It is different from Share-Market-Prices-v2 because:
- More functionalities
   - Log In
   - Sign Up
   - Try as a guest
   - Has a database of MySQL to store the store credentials of Sign Up and use them for Log In

- Is not on **Streamlit Community Cloud**
   - This is because I wasn't able to upload on **Streamlit Community Cloud** :disappointed:
